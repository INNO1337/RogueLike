# RogueLike
It was my second attempt to do good RogueLike game for my cpp course, but I didn't finish it.
Anyone who wants to finish my project or take some ideas from it, you're welcome!
Just let me know, it's pretty interesting for me.
# P.S
Don't forget to change some file paths in code to make it work proper.
To start the game type ./cmake-build-debug/RogueLike_Remastered from game directory.
